# DuckChat
DuckChat is a little project, maybe useless. It is a chat software without server, in a local network.
It's not secured, it's full of little bugs, but it works quite well anyway, so if you want to talk with your colleagues or your classmates, it's enough.
I plan to do a graphic interface with Qt... one day.

## Dependences
This programs uses the SFML Network library. And, it's basically all.
