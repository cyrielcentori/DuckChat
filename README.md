# DuckChat
DuckChat is a little project, maybe useless. It is a chat software without server, in a local network.
It's not secured, it's full of little bugs, but it works quite well anyway, so if you want to talk with your colleagues or your classmates, it's enough.
I plan to do a graphic interface with Qt... one day.
Oh, and I forgot : It's french. I will translate it in english, one day.

## Dependences
It uses the Qt5.12.0 libraries, and that's all.
